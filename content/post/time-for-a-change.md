I have finally put together a new website after 6 years of not touching any of my old sites. I decided it was time as I was becoming increasingly embarrassed by the old sites. Worried that anyone who looked into my previous work history would see a bunch of old looking websites or 404s.

## Portfolio site

The old portfolio website certainly did serve its purpose though as it was a nice quick an easy way to showcase my previous work during interviews. I could pull it up and talk through the different sites. It also ensured that I didn't draw a blank in those interviews trying to remember them.

## Blog

I put together the old blog site during my early years of working at my first proper agency. Using it as a tool to help learn but also pass information onto others. But the content had become so outdated it was certainly time for it to go.

## The new site

With the new site, I really do have the best of intentions of trying to blog a lot more. But I know from past experience that sticking to that promise is more difficult than it sounds.

I do a lot of back-end ASP.NET MVC development these days so I'm hoping that having a blog I can use some of my spare time to learn and blog about some other technologies.
